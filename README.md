# Oil-well-recommendation

For this project, I was assigned to choose the most profitable region for the construction of new wells for the company Oily Giant. 

Using three different datasets, each with points specific to a designated region, I trained a Linear Regression model to calculate the average volume of reserves and RMSE score for each region. The numbers provided from these models was not enough to suggest the location of the new wells. 

In order to ensure profitability, I created a function to calculate mean profit, risk of losses, and 95% confidence interval.
